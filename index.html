<p class="poem">“Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her;
If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,
Till she cry “Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover, I must have you!” -Thomas Parke D'Invilliers</i>

love, sing me a daisy, a fistful a penny
rain fever sweet in your riotous twenties 
star-spangled, light-speckled, glitter aplenty

love, sing me a maqam* and i promise to cry
you tears of black gold, till you will have me, high
on your stones, breathe in my bones, my bones, bone-dry.

you had your lush, lush rush, your roaring nights 
of brazen swirling silken shirts, wet, stretched tight 
over my heart of cold, vulgar, veblen-esque delight

and i, since you have left, have been scratching at it
a scab- a little, jaded, cynical something unfit to skip to stop,
buried deep in greenback kisses

love, sing me a song- anything-
drown me in my pool of roses,
of glimmering silver rings,
in your voice full of money, of snapped fairy wings

ain’t it a kitschy world, love, 
all that glitters is not gold. 
just like me,
look closely,
guldet blev til sand*.

*maqam: the system of melodic modes used in traditional Arabic music
*guldet blev til sand: Swedish, “gold turned into sand”, from the musica Kristina från Duvemåla (1995)</p>

the born, the alive, flailing, with wizened limbs,
with our white-capped heads hidden under bonnets, hidden
from sight, only wanted until we are 
born.

send help,
the good help,
the good help to help us go
from womb to tomb
to tomb but
not even a tomb.

we envy our unborn brethren.
they turn in their wombs, their gestation a sacrament 
denied us in living and we cry
for our mothers, mothers, mothers,
our fathers disavowed
of us and
we turn in our tomb but it’s
not even a tomb.

tell us, tell us our bones,
where we are to go
to save us the suffering of being
birthed 
birthed into a world 
that is adamant on our birth then
washes its hands of us.

trying to sub-divide a flat,
the opening jingle of a TV documentary three doors down,
a really uninteresting PSA on Radio One,
the sound of a waiter when someone is slow to order,
like durians being opened on a rock
like a whole housing estate airing out their dirty laundry
on a Monday, like an enthusiastic beginner
shuffling the Mahjong tiles, like Cha Chaan Teng,
like 7 oranges rolling down the slope
like 5 pickpockets pickpocketing
like the sound I heard when having an afternoon sleep
and someone tried to tune the piano.

if you could give to me the first whisper
that flits in splinters from the lips and
still lies long with
grief upon your cheek-
the one that hesitates and
sighs to start again
to
tell of parted halves and
quartered quarters but slumbering
forgets to rewind and
repeat.

if you could give to me the first pain
and the second that rushes through
the windy lanes in chorus to salute the
heart in its casket,
remembering the name in
the eye of your
aching dream-
perhaps, then,
you will drown in its terrible
sillage,
you my one most
tender,
tongueless theme.

if you could give the first falling to me,
the first falling from a
great height after which you will
find yourself alive at last-
gliding with such irrationality through
feverish spring,
and sweet, and fresh perhaps
your blood will sing and
the moon, will for once,
arch towards the looking-glass.

and now
i will give to you my
end,
my one and final true,
therefore-
song and roar and murmur
(my voice)
to whom refuge bright my soul
belongs
through and through and 
through.

<p class="poem">
the day you left home with a one-way ticket, 
was the day i told you that
walking on air felt
the same as treading water.

the day you waded into the ocean,
was the day i clawed around for some vestigial 
memory of fire,
and not remembering,
sat in the darkness, turned
Skyward.

many a day you watched as the 
sun began and
ended, Genesis upon
Genesis and sleep thick
upon liquid sleep, and far
i take on the colour of
your shadow, or your limpid eyes, 
becoming a hymn of your strained 
breathing
on the telephone.

at night i dream of you drifting,
my lover gold and rippling sea, 
like a child, like my song;
but stirring, i return to the
hum and cry of this brief world, and 
bare, and cold.

love is not
a house or even a tent
it is before that, and colder:

the edge of the forest, the edge
of the whitewashed outhouse where
someone with a nail, scrapes dimly in the paint; 
LOVE IS NOT A VICTORY MARCH.

where having fought, and lost, 
you make for yourself a fragility,
a soft and quivering precious 
it is the
sea and the sea and the 
mountain and the mountain 
swimming in your pocket, 
awaiting creation to begin.
